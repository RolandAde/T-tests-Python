# T-Test Analysis with Python 🧪📊

This repository contains a series of Python scripts demonstrating the application of different types of **t-tests** using realistic, synthetic datasets. Each notebook is self-contained and follows a clear, step-by-step statistical testing workflow including data preparation, hypothesis formulation, test execution, and result interpretation.

## 📁 Contents

| Script | Test Type | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `one_sample_ttest.ipynb` | One-Sample T-Test | Tests whether the mean height of individuals differs significantly from a hypothetical population mean. |
| `paired_sample_ttest.ipynb` | Paired-Sample T-Test | Compares athletes’ weights before and after a training program to assess changes over time. |
| `independent_ttest.ipynb` | Independent-Sample T-Test | Compares the mean blood pressure between two independent groups. |
| `dependent_ttest.ipynb` | Dependent-Sample T-Test | Compares student performance under a new teaching method versus a traditional one, with each student exposed to both methods. |

## 📊 Methodology

Each notebook follows this structure:

1. **Problem Statement**  
   Clear definition of the hypothesis being tested.

2. **Dataset Overview**  
   Description of the dataset, including variables used and any preprocessing.

3. **Assumption Checks**  
   Where applicable, assumptions such as normality and variance homogeneity are checked.

4. **T-Test Execution**  
   The appropriate `scipy.stats` function is used to perform the test.

5. **Interpretation of Results**  
   Includes p-values, test statistics, and conclusions based on significance thresholds.
